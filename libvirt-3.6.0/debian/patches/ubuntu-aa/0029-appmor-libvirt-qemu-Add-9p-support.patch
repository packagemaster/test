Subject: [PATCH 29/33] appmor, libvirt-qemu: Add 9p support

Add fowner and fsetid to libvirt-qemu profile.

Bug-Ubuntu: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1378434

Note: While upstreaming Serge and Guido were not very happy
with granting those permissions unconditionally. Instead they
thought it would be better to do this in virt-aa-helper only
if 9p filesystem is in use.

Forwarded: no (part of continuous upstreaming effort)
